# Google-App-Store-Rating-
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data pre-processing on a Google App Store rating dataset to analyze the factors influencing app ratings. Cleaned the dataset by removing duplicates and dropping invalid categories. Handled missing values in the rating column and created a new column for rating categorization. Converted the 'Reviews' column to a numeric data type and handled outliers using a log transformation. Developed insights into the distribution of app ratings and identified key factors affecting app ratings and optimizing app development strategies for improved ratings and user satisfaction.
